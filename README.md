Hello everyone! Welcome to my repository! (credits to spyboyxda1 for the original repository)
You don't need to rent servers offered from example Macincloud!
These macOS VMs hosted in a server are completely free and they include Xcode, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and much more!
Just connect with a VNC client to the URL provided by ngrok, open Teamviewer installer, install Teamviewer, open it, set the necessary permissions, enter the id and the password and voila! Free high performance macOS VMs server hosted!
Unfortunately, there is no audio support. 
Follow the tutorial on my yt channel for the full version of this tutorial:
